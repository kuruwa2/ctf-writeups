# VirtualJava

## Description

There's nothing like executing my own code in Java in my own special way.

[VirtualJava.java](VirtualJava.java)

## Solution

The [class](VirtualJava.class) operates like some kind of assembly code.

It parses through the input characters and obtain an output. If the output in each step falls to owo[1], it would be wrong.

It's too tedious to reverse it artificially, so I reversed it using the given code.

Each step I at a printable character to the string and check the outcome. If the output was good, add it to the answer and move on to next word.

```
        for (int i = 32; i < 127; ++i){
            String aa = Character.toString((char)i);
            String a = ans + aa;
            ...
            boolean right=true;
            for (int j = 0; j < c.length; j++) {
                String s = getOutput(Math.abs(java.run(j, (int) c[j])));
                if (s.equals(owo[1])) {
                    right = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (right == true){
                System.out.println("yes");
                ans = ans + aa;
            }
```

Finally, it split out the answer automatically.

```

```
