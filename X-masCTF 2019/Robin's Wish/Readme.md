Santa tried using public key cryptography to secure his letters, but his plan turned out to be a failure! After deleting his private keys, one of his elves found an encrypted letter from a child named Robin. Asking Robin what he wants for Christmas would be unprofessional, so the elf asked you to decrypt the letter. He also gave you access to a more basic copy of Santa's service.

Help Santa decrypt Robin's letter and you will definitely not be on the 'naughty' list this year!
