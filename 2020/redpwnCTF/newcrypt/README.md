### Solution

The script generated 4 numbers by:
```python=
for i in range(4):
    x = getPrime((1<<10)-random.randint(1<<0,1<<8))
    y = inverse(x,(self.p-1)*(self.q-1)//GCD(self.p-1,self.q-1))
    numbers.append(y)
```
The vulnerabililty here is that xs' bit length is small compared to n, so lattice-based attack could exploit it.

[Howgrave-Graham and Seifertâ€™s Attack](https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/037.pdf) had concluded that when given 4 public exponents whose private components' bit length is below $\delta=0.441$ times the bit length of n, it's likely to factorize n efficiently.

The bit length of x here is about $\frac{1024-128}{2048} = 0.4375$.

#### The math

By this relation of e and d, we can have 10 basic equations: ($G$ is GCD and $s=n-\phi$)

The basic idea is using these equations to construct a vector-matrix equation $xB=v$ where $B$ is an upper triangle matrix and

For the purpose that will be mentioned later, we want to choose $G_{i,j}$ as many as possible and $W_i$ as less as possible.

My choice was:

Every row of $B$ is a vector much bigger than $v$ and $v$ is linear combination of these rows.

To apply lattice attack, we still need that $v$ to be balanced. Notice that $e_i\approx n$, $d_i\approx n^\delta$, $k_i\approx n^\delta$, $s\approx n^{0.5}$, so $v$ is dominated by the last component $\Pi(1-k_is)\approx n^{2+4\delta}$.

Hence we need to multiply both $B$ and $v$ by a diagonal matrix $D$

```
diagonal_matrix([n^2,n^1.5,n^(2+delta),n,n^(2+delta),
                 n^(1.5+delta),n^(1.5+delta),n^0.5,
                 n^(2+delta),n^(1.5+delta),n^(2+2*delta),n^(1+delta),
                 n^(2+2*delta),n^(1+delta),n^(1+delta),1])
```

Now we can apply LLL algorithm to obtain $v$ and $x$, then calculate $\phi=e_1\times\frac{d_1k_2k_3k_4}{k_1k_2k_3k_4}$. If $\phi$ is calculated correctly, the roots of $x^2-(n+1-\phi)x+n=0$ will be p and q consequently.

The only thing left is that we don't know the GCD of $p-1$ and $q-1$, it could be any even number. Hence for every possible $G$, we need to multiply $e$ by $G$ first. It turned out that the GCD is just $2$ though.


#### Reason why not choose $W_i$ but $G_{i,j}$

![](https://i.imgur.com/o5qJ6Yl.png)

Using the theorem, to increase the success rate of the attack, we need the volume of $B$ to be as large as possible. It means large components of $D$, which means small right hand side of each equation we choose.

By some observation, all the right hand side of the equations consists of $k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$.

When choosing $G_{i,j}$, we elimintae $k_i$ and $k_j$ but only multiply the number by $(k_i-k_j)$. On the other hand, choosing $W_i$ multiplies the number by $k_is$, which is much larger.

We can even calculate the upperbound of bit length of $d_i$ by the theorem.
